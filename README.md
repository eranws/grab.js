## A 3D workshop for creative artists and coders 

In the following months I will be holding a workshop that will bridge between 3D games and natural gameplay.

The purpose of the workshop is to introduce cutting edge technology, using common web tools (browsers).
The workshop is self contained and all experience that is needed is learned 'On the Go'.

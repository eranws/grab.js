## the Stack

* hardware = sensor / camera & chip / (kinect). // Some background about depth, Ir, sensors
* driver - openni, "Depth Frame" (C)
* middleware - nite, recognition, "What is there?" (C++)
* server - websockets (C++) // this line enables multiplayer apps, since the app can run on another device
* client - app, game. In our case - browser (javascript)

//	Q: how many are programmers? what language?

Browser - a Powerful Development tool
	Good seperation of worker and waiter, (client/server), cpu bound / io bound
	Runtime - C++, websockets, Browser - Javascript
	Recent advances in GPUs, internet standards (HTML5, WebGL) - Three.js

Why javascript? walkthrough
	inspect, (F12 / ctrl+shift+J - dev tools)
	hack (ESC - console)
	debug (breakpoint)
	* easy debugging example, famous website

event loop
each frame, the 'server' waits for a frame from the camera, process it, and sends out: 
	* hand position
	* grab state
	* (skeleton)

hack'n'slash (or: hotCoture)
	take working examples
	replace the wiring
	// exercise
